/* 🧪 THE ECONOMY GAUNTLET — the regression gate for /src/economy.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Run from the repo root:   node tools/economy-tests/run.mjs
   Exits non-zero on any failure, so it can gate a deploy.

   Three rounds, and each exists because it caught something real:
     1. HOSTILE INPUT   NaN/Infinity dt, corrupt saves, zero population, a
                        garbage host object. Found: an Infinity dt that ran
                        three economic days off a bad clock read; a NaN
                        population from one bad byte in a save; NaN leaking
                        into the freight panel.
     2. INVARIANTS      Conservation of Cinder across 40 randomized cities ×
                        120 days, save/load completeness, price clamps, bank
                        solvency, level gates, the faucet ceiling, the payout
                        bound. Found: three unsaved state variables, one of
                        which let a firm take a SECOND loan by reloading.
     3. INTEGRATION     Buildings → businesses → jobs, through the same map
                        node-city uses. Found: a rebuilt tile inheriting the
                        previous business's balance sheet.

   ⚠ Round 3 models node-city's REAL population cap (4 + 6 per housing level).
     An earlier version let population grow freely, which made a tuning change
     look strictly beneficial when against the real cap it deleted the
     unemployment mechanic entirely. A test that does not match the host's
     constraints will confidently point the wrong way. */
